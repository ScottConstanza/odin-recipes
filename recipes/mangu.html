    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a signature breakfast dish that will have you full for a while. This paired with fried eggs, salami, and cheese make for an excellent way to wake up.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Green plantains</li>
        <li>2 Eggs</li>
        <li>Salami</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

        <li><em>Step 1:</em> Peel the green plantains and cut them in 3 piece sections to add to a boiling pot.</li>
        <li><em>Step 2:</em> As the plantains start to boil and soften up, add some salt for flavor.</li>
        <li><em>Step 3:</em> Cut up some cheese and salami to fry up. Use desirable amount.</li>
        <li><em>Step 4:</em> Heat up a skillet with some oil and start frying the cheese, then the salami. Once both are done, fry your eggs.</li>
